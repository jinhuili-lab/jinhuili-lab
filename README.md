### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ This is  **Jinhui Li**.  
- âœ¨ Now I am a Ph.D student in America. 
- âš¡ I focus on Bioinformatics and **Biostatistics** and enjoy coding.
- ðŸ’¬ Less is more, do the interesting things.
### Experience
- ðŸ¤” When I got my bachelor's degree, I was interested in computer science.
- ðŸ˜„ So I joined a biomedical company as a bioengineer and focused on the bioinformatics analysis for NGS data. The company developed many products for PGS(3rd-generation IVF), such as a reagent test kit for detecting the variance of Genomics and building the bioinformatics cloud platform.
- ðŸ‘¯ After one year, because of the low salary, I want to pursue a master's degree. During the part of my master's degree, metagenomics attracted my attention. It is my first time to use AI techniques and my first time to publish a paper as a first author.
- â˜› Now I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree. If you want to cooperate with me, I can help you with multi-omics analysis, software development, and database development, please contact me by email: ijinhui@foxmail.com.
