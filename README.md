### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ This is  **Jinhui Li**.  
- âœ¨ Now I am a Ph.D student in America. 
- âš¡ I focus on Bioinformatics and **Biostatistics** and enjoy coding.
- ðŸ’¬ Less is more, do the interesting things.
## Privous Work.
- ðŸ¤” When I got my bachelor's degree, I was interested in computer science.
- ðŸ˜„ So I joined a biomedical company as a bioengineer and focused on the bioinformatics analysis for NGS data. The company developed many products for PGS(3rd-generation IVF), such as a reagent test kit for detecting the variance of Genomics and building the bioinformatics cloud platform.
- ðŸ‘¯ After one year, because of the low salary, I want to pursue a master's degree. During the part of my master's degree, metagenomics attracted my attention. It is my first time to use AI techniques and my first time to publish a paper as a first author.
