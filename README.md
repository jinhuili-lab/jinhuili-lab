### Hi there 
- ðŸ”­ This is  **Jinhui Li**.  
- âœ¨ ~~I am an algorithm researcher in the R&D center of BGI group.~~- Now I am a Ph.D student in America. 
- âš¡ I focus on **Bioinformatics algorithm** and **Biostatistics method**.
- ðŸ‘‹ I enjoy coding.
- ðŸ’¬ Less is more, do the interesting things.

### Experience
- ðŸ¤” When I got my bachelor's degree, I was interested in computer science.
- ðŸ˜„ So I joined a biomedical company as a bioengineer and focused on the bioinformatics analysis for NGS data. The company developed many products for PGS(3rd-generation IVF), such as a reagent test kit for detecting the variance of Genomics and building the bioinformatics cloud platform.
- ðŸ‘¯ After one year, because of the low salary, I want to pursue a master's degree. During the part of my master's degree, metagenomics attracted my attention. It is my first time to use AI techniques and my first time to publish a paper as a first author. I published two papers as the first author finally and got the National Scholarship of China.
- â˜› After that, I worked for the BGI group as a bioinformatics algorithms  researcher and developed some software for the MGI sequencers, including G99 and T20. Relying on the Ztron system and PFI kit, users can get the website report after inputting the biology sample into the MGI sequencer. 
- â˜Ž Now I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree. If possible, we can cooperate with multi-omics analysis, software development, and database development, please contact me by email: ijinhui@foxmail.com.
